Android even allows apps to monitor data changes on the clipboard by registering a callback listener to the system. The risk is related to mechanism of copy & paste in Android system. The information which was copied by user or application, is once stored in the buffer called Clipboard. The information stored in Clipboard is distributed to other applications when it is pasted by a user or an application. So there is a risk which leads to information leakage in this Clipboard function. It is because the entity of Clipboard is single in a system and any application can obtain the information stored in Clipboard at any time by using ClipboardManager. It means that all the information which user copied/cut, is leaked out to the malicious application. In contrast, Android considers each app as a different user with different privilege. Due to the global unguarded access, various users, i.e., apps, can arbitrarily operate on Android Clipboard without any restriction."
